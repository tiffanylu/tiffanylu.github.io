#### [Doing “Tech 4 Good” Well: Designing Technology Solutions for Sustainable Social Impact in Disadvantaged Communities][1]

*Submitted to the Department of Computer and Information Science in fulfillment of the Senior Capstone Thesis for the degree of BAS in Computer Science (ASCS) at the University of Pennsylvania.*

## Abstract
The ubiquity of computing technologies has revolutionized not only our global social consciousness, but also our collective abilities to innovate for socioeconomic impact. The past eight years have seen an unprecedented swell of interest in developing technologies to uplift marginalized, underserved or underrepresented communities. Yet while good intentions and technical expertise can serve as catalysts of revolutionary innovation, there is a unique set of concerns involved in designing technology solutions for disadvantaged populations. This paper strives to investigate those considerations and synthesize concrete suggestions for how to “do good” well.

In this thesis, I first summarize the rise of interest in leveraging computer technologies for social good and their potential for accelerating socioeconomic growth in disadvantaged communities. In recognizing the human vulnerabilities exposed by such endeavors, I draw attention to necessary considerations and propose a need for multidisciplinary analysis. Drawing from an existing field of research on the use of information and communication technologies in international development, I advocate for the adoption of human-centered design and community-driven development paradigms. Finally, I present a literature review of best practices for sustainable impact and conclude with a case study describing my experiences designing a technology platform for LGBTQ asylum seekers in the United States.
