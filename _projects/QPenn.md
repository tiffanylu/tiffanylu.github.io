#### Supplement Editor

QPenn is the University of Pennsylvania's annual LGBTQ Cultural Week. The QPenn Supplement to Penn's student paper, [*The Daily Pennsylvanian*][3], features work by queer students at the University of Pennsylvania.

QPenn week consists of events hosted by the various constituent groups of Lambda focusing on different aspects of LGBT life, including intimate partner violence, film screenings and the annual Pride Games, aimed at tackling homophobia in athletics.

### Supplement
As Editor for the QPenn Supplement to Penn's student paper, [*The Daily Pennsylvanian*][3], I curated submissions and designed the supplement. The cover design conveys the 2013 theme, “50 Shades of Gay,” which highlights the range of identities within the queer community.
